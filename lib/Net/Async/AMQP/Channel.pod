=head1 NAME

Net::Async::AMQP::Channel - represents a single channel in an MQ connection

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.005

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use IO::Async::Loop;
 use Net::Async::AMQP;
 my $amqp = Net::Async::AMQP->new(loop => my $loop = IO::Async::Loop->new);
 $amqp->connect(
   host => 'localhost',
   username => 'guest',
   password => 'guest',
   on_connected => sub {
   }
 );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head1 METHODS

=head2 confirm_mode

Switches confirmation mode on for this channel.
In confirm mode, all messages must be ACKed
explicitly after delivery.

Returns a L<Future> which will resolve with this
channel once complete.

 $ch->confirm_mode ==> $ch

=head2 exchange_declare

Declares a new exchange.

Returns a L<Future> which will resolve with this
channel once complete.

 $ch->exchange_declare(
  exchange   => 'some_exchange',
  type       => 'fanout',
  autodelete => 1,
 ) ==> $ch

=head2 queue_declare

Returns a L<Future> which will resolve with the
new L<Net::Async::AMQP::Queue> instance once complete.

 $ch->queue_declare(
  queue      => 'some_queue',
 ) ==> $q

=head2 publish

Publishes a message on this channel.

Returns a L<Future> which will resolve with the
channel instance once the server has confirmed publishing is complete.

 $ch->publish(
  exchange => 'some_exchange',
  routing_key => 'some.rkey.here',
  type => 'some_type',
 ) ==> $ch

=head2 qos

Changes QOS settings on the channel. Probably most
useful for limiting the number of messages that can
be delivered to us before we have to ACK/NAK to
proceed.

Returns a L<Future> which will resolve with the
channel instance once the operation is complete.

 $ch->qos(
  prefetch_count => 5,
  prefetch_size  => 1048576,
 ) ==> $ch

=head2 ack

Acknowledge a specific delivery.

Returns a L<Future> which will resolve with the
channel instance once the operation is complete.

 $ch->ack(
  delivery_tag => 123,
 ) ==> $ch

Example output:

        'method_id' => 40,
        'reply_code' => 404,
        'class_id' => 60,
        'reply_text' => 'NOT_FOUND - no exchange \'invalidchan\' in vhost \'mv\''

=head2 on_close

Called when the channel has been closed.

=head2 send_frame

Proxy frame sending requests to the parent
L<Net::Async::AMQP> instance.

=head2 close

Ask the server to close this channel.

Returns a L<Future> which will resolve with the
channel instance once the operation is complete.

 $ch->close(
  code => 404,
  text => 'something went wrong',
 ) ==> $ch

=head1 METHODS - Accessors

=head2 amqp

The parent L<Net::Async::AMQP> instance.

=head2 bus

Event bus. Used for sharing channel-specific events.

=head2 write

Proxy a write operation through the parent L<Net::Async::AMQP> instance.

=head2 future

The underlying L<Future> for this channel which
will resolve to the instance once the channel
is open.

=head2 id

This channel ID.
