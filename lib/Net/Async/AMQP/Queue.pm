=head1 METHODS

=cut

=head2 listen

Starts a consumer on this queue.

 $q->listen(
  channel => $ch,
  ack => 1
 )->then(sub {
  my ($q, $ctag) = @_;
  print "Queue $q has ctag $ctag\n";
  ...
 })

Expects the following named parameters:

=over 4

=item * channel - which channel to listen on

=item * ack (optional) - true to enable ACKs

=item * consumer_tag (optional) - specific consumer tag

=back

Returns a L<Future> which resolves with ($queue, $consumer_tag) on
completion. If this is cancelled before we receive the Basic.ConsumeOk
acknowledgement from the server, we'll issue an explicit cancel.

=head2 cancel

Cancels the given consumer.

 $q->cancel(
  consumer_tag => '...',
 )->then(sub {

Expects the following named parameters:

Binds this queue to an exchange.

 $q->bind_exchange(

Expects the following named parameters:

=head2 delete

Deletes this queue.

 $q->delete(
